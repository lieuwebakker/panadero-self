# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Maintaining multiple versions of the library is quite time consuming, so
the majority of the effort is focused on the latest major release.

If you do require a version outside of this chart updated with patch fix,
please [contact me](mailto:github@ricmoo.com).

| Version | Supported                                  | Initial Release   |

| 0.1.x   | :x:                                        | 2023-02-14        |
